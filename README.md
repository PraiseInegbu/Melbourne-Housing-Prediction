# Melbourne-Housing-Prediction

Melbourne Housing Price Prediction
This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts housing prices in Melbourne. The model is trained on historical housing data and aims to provide accurate predictions based on various features such as Rooms, Bathrooms, Landsize, BuildingArea, YearBuilt, Lattitude and Longtitudes.

Project Overview
Data Source:

The model is trained on a dataset comprising historical housing prices in Melbourne. The dataset includes information such as property location, number of bedrooms, land size, and more.
Machine Learning Model:

The predictive model is built using DecisionTreeRegressor algorithm on scikit-learn framework. It goes through a comprehensive training process to learn the patterns in the data and make accurate predictions.
Jupyter Notebook:

The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (First model.ipynb) where the model is developed and trained. The notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
